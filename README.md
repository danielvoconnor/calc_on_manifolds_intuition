# How would you discover the generalized Stokes's theorem?

It is possible to derive the generalized Stokes's theorem using the same type of intuitive argument that physicists use to derive Green's theorem, the divergence theorem, and the classical Stokes's theorem.

The notes CalcOnManifolds_Intuition_Tufte.pdf are my attempt to explain this.
